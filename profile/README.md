## About COTS

Established in 1972 at Northern Illinois University by Dr. Clark D. Neher and Dr. Ladd Thomas, COTS was conceived as a kind of laboratory in which scholars, students and practitioners engaged in the study of Thailand could assemble to exchange ideas, share their research, and test the validity of their contentions and approaches to understanding Thailand.

## Origin of these repositories

In 2021, Ohio University host its first online conference for COTS (the first ever online version was hosted by Northern Illinois University in 2020). During organization of the 2021 conference, serveral tools were created. Notable tools are

- Submission parser
- Scripts to bulk update Zoom meetings
- URL shortener and redirector.

To collect all the tools in one place, this Github organization was created.
